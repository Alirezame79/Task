# Task
### Task is a sweet Project Written in Kotlin-Android and is highly in standard mode.
#### Task Project is a good notebook for your notes. It's in local storage and no body can access it. As it seems it is made by Room-Jetpack library and As I said is highly secured.
##### All classes use ViewBinding and use no findViewById. Also because of clean code and low size objects, the app is soooooo small.
#### I try to make it in MVVM architecture mode. It is so clean and understandable.
##### Finally This is just the beggining. Wait for more... :)
